# Uniformed Search Algorithm

## Overview

The **Uniformed Search Algorithm** project aims to demonstrate how uniformed search techniques work in problem-solving scenarios. This project is designed for educational purposes, providing a clear understanding of the algorithm's mechanics, advantages, and applications.

## What is a Uniformed Search Algorithm?

Uniformed search algorithms are a category of algorithms that explore the search space without any knowledge about the problem's structure. They systematically explore nodes based on certain criteria until they find a solution. Common uniformed search algorithms include **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

## Key Features

- **Demonstration of Algorithm Mechanics**: Visual representation of how the algorithm explores nodes.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Allows users to follow along as the algorithm processes.
- **Performance Analysis**: Comparison of different search strategies in terms of time and space complexity.

## Components

1. **Algorithm Implementation**: Code for BFS, DFS, DLS, GBFS, IDS, UCS and A* Search to demonstrate their functionality.
2. **Visual Representation**: Graphical interface to visualize the search process.
3. **Testing Framework**: Tools to validate the algorithm's efficiency and correctness.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Necessary libraries (if applicable)
